# SLC Artificial Neural Network Training
This repository contains the materials delivered in the Artificial Neural Network training held in Software Laboratory Center (SLC), Binus University on August 27-29, 2018.

The codes are separated for each session, with materials as follow:
1. Session 1: Introduction to Python, Perceptron, and Least Mean Square
   * Introduction to Python
   * Perceptron
   * Least Mean Square
2. Session 2.1: Multilayer Perceptron
   * Multilayer Perceptron
   * Tensorboard
   * Multilayer Perceptron Tuning
3. Session 2.2: Recurrent Neural Network
   * Recurrent Neural Network
   * Recurrent Neural Network Tuning
4. Session 3.1: Self-Organizing Map and Principal Component Analysis
   * Self-Organizing Map
   * Principal Component Analysis (to be added in this repository)
   * Eigenface using PCA (to be added in this repository)
5. Session 3.2: Convolutional Neural Network
   * Convolutional Neural Network
   
All codes are written in Python 3.6 with NumPy and TensorFlow 1.10

Later version of TensorFlow may introduce compatibility issues with these codes
